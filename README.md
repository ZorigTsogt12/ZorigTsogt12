# Hi, My name is Zorig
I am currently studying to be a full-stack engineer through codecademy. I am always looking to learn new things and improve my development ability.
The languages I am proficient in are: 
1. Python
2. Javascript
3. Java
4. HTML/CSS

In the future, I want to work with different frameworks and APIs to fully get a grasp of what they do and how they can be implemented into my aspirations.

My favourite quote is: 

*Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.* - Robert F. Kennedy

# Collaboration
At the moment I am still relatively new to collaboration work. However if you are from a codecademy career path and is looking for any help or any collaborations on projects, please feel free to message me on discord zokkow0w.

As always have a great day.
